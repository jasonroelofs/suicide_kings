 - Allow master to force-retract a bid
 - Change 'bid' raid text, add "Help" button to describe how to use the system.
 - Add "Close Bid" button to mod
 - Put timer on bidding, to auto-close in 15(?) seconds
 - Just plain clean up the button mess in the UI

== New Data

 - Track items won
 - Track raid attendance and raids run
 - (make sure the above are synced)

== Handling Raid Attendance

 - Figure out system of tracking attendance nicely
 - Handle people entering / leaving raids mid-raid

== Syncing

 - Have each person have a "last synced" or something to designate who has the
   most up-to-date SK data.

== Notes

Look into for examples:
 - Loot hog
